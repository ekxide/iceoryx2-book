# Quickstart

## Jump into Code

Itching to get straight into coding with `iceoryx2`?
The tutorial on [Wiring a Robot Brain](/tutorials/wiring-a-robot-brain/index)
is a great starting point to see the code in action.

You can get started right away with any of the following languages:

````{grid} 1 1 2 3
:gutter: 2

```{grid-item-card} Rust
:link: /tutorials/wiring-a-robot-brain/publish-subscribe
:link-type: doc
:shadow: none
```

```{grid-item-card} Python
:link: /tutorials/wiring-a-robot-brain/publish-subscribe
:link-type: doc
:shadow: none
```

```{grid-item-card} C++
:link: /tutorials/wiring-a-robot-brain/publish-subscribe
:link-type: doc
:shadow: none
```

```{grid-item-card} C
:link: /tutorials/wiring-a-robot-brain/publish-subscribe
:link-type: doc
:shadow: none
```

```{grid-item-card} Go
:shadow: none
:class-card: muted-card
```

```{grid-item-card} ...
:shadow: none
:class-card: muted-card
```

Build an intuition for what shared memory communication entails.
```

```{grid-item-card} Communication Model
:link: /fundamentals/communication-model
:link-type: doc
:shadow: none

Get familiar with how communication is established.
```

```{grid-item-card} Execution Control
