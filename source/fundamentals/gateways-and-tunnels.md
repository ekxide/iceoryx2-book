# Gateways and Tunnels

Gateways and Tunnels extend the communication of `iceoryx2` across host
boundaries by leveraging popular network communication middlewares and
libraries. They can be run in separate processes, thereby isolating network
communication from safety-critical code.

Host-to-host Communication

## Gateways

Gateways translate `iceoryx2` payloads into data formats used by different
network communication middlewares and libraries. In addition to extending the
communication beyond a single host, this translation enables applications that
are not using `iceoryx2` to participate in the communication.

## Tunnels

Tunnels propagate raw `iceoryx2` payloads as-is between hosts running
`iceoryx2`. By avoiding data transformation, tunnels minimize processing
overhead and maintain the native `iceoryx2` communication semantics
across distributed systems.
