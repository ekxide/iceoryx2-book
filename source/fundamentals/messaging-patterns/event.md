Event Communication Model
```

A messaging pattern for coordinating execution between participants. The
`Event` messaging pattern is not intended for sharing payload data, but
rather communicating to other participants that there is work to do.

## Mechanism

Events over Native Sleep/Wake-up Mechanisms
```

The event messaging pattern abstracts over sleep and wake-up
mechanisms of the platform.
Listeners can put their thread into a sleep state and be woken up by notifiers
on the service.

A single participant can handle multiple listeners
[using a `Waitset`](/fundamentals/execution-control.md#waitset), which allows the
participant to wait on several event sources simultaneously.

An `EventId` is provided with each notification, either assigned automatically
or specified by the notifier, to facilitate event handling by the receiving
participants.
